GLOF PREDICTION WITHSAR
This project leverages Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict and provide early warnings for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).

Key Features:

Dataset: Curated Sentinel-1 SAR data, categorized into pre-GLOF, during-GLOF, and post-GLOF phases.
Algorithms: Implemented CNN-based models for effective feature extraction and high-accuracy predictions.
Remote Sensing Parameters: Incorporated lake size, perimeter, snow cover, water surface elevation, and precipitation patterns to enhance model robustness.
Dashboard: Developed an interactive React-based visualization tool for real-time and historical data analysis.
Impact: Enables proactive disaster management and mitigates risks associated with GLOFs.
This repository includes the dataset, model architecture, and deployment instructions. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
